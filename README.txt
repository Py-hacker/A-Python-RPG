A PYTHON RPG


Made by Py_hacker. Only Py_hacker can do what he wants with that. In other words: copyright Py_hacker

To play this RPG, you WILL need Pygame, Python (Obviously) and everything Pygame needs to run. If not sure of what to download, download what you need depending of 
what you are using (Linux, Windows, etc.) here: www.manning.com/sande

Wanna base your work out of that or modify it? Do it, but please state the original author of the original game (me).
