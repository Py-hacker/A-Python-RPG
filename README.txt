THE DIAMOND ROCKS


Made by me (Py_hacker). Only I can do what I want with that. In other words: copyright Py_hacker

To play this RPG, you WILL need Pygame, Python (Obviously) and everything Pygame needs to run. If not sure of what to 
download, download what you need depending of what you are using (Linux, Windows, etc.) here: www.manning.com/sande
But I don't know if THE DIAMOND ROCKS works with Linux/Mac.

Also, don't forget to write the FULL path of the folder where the main.py file is in the folder.txt file! Don't 
separate the main.py file and the other files and folders! Don't rename the folders in Other_code and Sprites!

For better gaming experience, use a PC with a computer screen bigger than 744 x 744. And use Stani's Python Editor, which
is in the "pack" downloaded at www.manning.com/sande
